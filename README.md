Enhanced Face and Eye Detection in Real-Time Using Haarcascades in OpenCV
Overview
This project focuses on developing a real-time face and eye detection system using Haarcascades with the OpenCV library. The system is designed to enhance accuracy and efficiency in detecting faces and eyes, making it suitable for applications in security, surveillance, human-computer interaction, and driver assistance technologies. By leveraging machine learning techniques, the project aims to provide a versatile and effective solution that performs well on various platforms.
Technologies
The project utilizes Python as the programming language and relies on libraries such as OpenCV, NumPy, and scikit-learn. The development environment is managed using Anaconda, and Jupyter Notebooks are used for interactive coding and documentation.
Installation
To set up the project, start by installing Anaconda, which can be downloaded from the official website. After installing Anaconda, create a virtual environment specifically for this project and activate it. Then, install the required libraries, including OpenCV, NumPy, scikit-learn, and Matplotlib, to ensure all necessary tools are available.
Usage
The system provides functionality for real-time face and eye detection using a webcam, enabling immediate feedback and interaction. Additionally, performance evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score can be used to assess the effectiveness of the detection algorithms and make improvements as needed.
File Structure
The project directory includes folders for Haarcascades XML files, sample images, and scripts for detection and performance evaluation. It also contains Jupyter Notebooks for interactive analysis and a README file for documentation.
License
The project is licensed under the MIT License, allowing for open use and modification.
